# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) 

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)** to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). PINNs are a class of neural networks that incorporate the physical laws governing a system directly into the loss function, enabling accurate predictions while reducing dependency on large datasets.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to solve **Burgers' equation**, a fundamental PDE in fluid mechanics, using PINNs. This project aims to:
- Illustrate the application of PINNs to solve PDEs.
- Showcase the integration of domain knowledge into neural network training.
- Optimize network accuracy and performance.

## Features
- **Custom Loss Function**: Incorporates physical constraints from Burgers' equation into the loss calculation.
- **PyTorch-based Implementation**: Leverages the PyTorch library for building and training neural networks.

## Methodology

1. **Define the PDE**: Implement Burgers' equation in its differential form.
2. **Create the PINN Model**:
    - Input: Spatial and temporal coordinates.
    - Output: Predicted values for the dependent variable.
3. **Loss Function**:
    - Data Loss: Minimizes the error on observed data points.
    - Physics Loss: Enforces compliance with Burgers' equation.
4. **Optimization**:
    - Use Adam optimizer to minimize the combined loss.
5. **Visualization**:
    - Plot predictions and ground truth for evaluation.
